# Optimization and mathematical programming with applications to spatial data & scaling up computations in Julia
**Dates:** Nov 20 & 21, 2023

**Time:**  10:30am-noon; 1:30pm-3pm

**Location**: University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA


Data analysis has become one of the core processes in virtually any professional activity. 
The collection of data becomes easier and less expensive, so we have ample access to it.

The Julia language which was designed to address the typical challenges that data scientists 
face when using other tools. Julia, like Python, supports an efficient and convenient development process. 
At the same time, programs developed in Julia have performance comparable to C.


**Installation instructions**
Installation instructions can be found in materials for the day 1.

Once installed the code can be run as
```
using Pkg
Pkg.activate(".") # assumes running the code in the main folder of this repository
Pkg.instantiate() # needed only when run for the first time 
using IJulia
ENV["JULIA_NUM_THREADS"]=4
notebook(dir=".")
```
